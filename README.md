- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is James Lukas. I'm currently a sophomore in Santa Monica College and I want to transfer into as an electrical engineering major or computer science and engineering major. 
 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about coding and I hope to be able to use to in my future career where I want to work with both the hardware and software. Right now I am leaning towards a systems engineer career. However, nothing is set in stone and I hope I get lucky enough to get some opportunities.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ in my class and I hope to be able to put more of my projects on here. I am also learning Python by myself, so there may be an occasional Python project on here.

- ðŸ“«You can reach me on Jlukas6249@gmail.com for whatever reason.
