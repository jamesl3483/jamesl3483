- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is James Lukas. I'm currently a Senior in University of California Berkeley in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
 
- ðŸ‘€ This github's public repos are random repos that I havent gotten around to delete yet. Most of the stuff I am working on is private so, we'll see if there are any meaningful projects that can be put public for now.
  
- ðŸ“«You can reach me on Jlukas6249@gmail.com for whatever reason.
